## Introduction 

Hello everyone, my name is Christopher Chandler, and I am an aspiring programmer! 
If you speak Japanese, then please feel free to call me <ruby><rb>栗栖</rb><rt>クリス</rt><ruby>! 
If you do not speak Japanese, then please simply call me Chris! And if you are Japanese, then
I am sure that you will understand my logo.

## About me
I am an American based in Germany at the moment. 
I have been interested in computers for my whole life, 
but I got into programming at the end of 2019. 
I am working on a multitude of passion projects and tools at the moment to improve my coding skills. 
I am mostly interested in NLP tasks as that was my minor in my double major:
* General French Philology
* Linguistics with a minor in Computational Linguistics

### Languages

Besides programming, I am very much interested in languages: 
* English (Native)
* German (C2)
* French (C1)
* Japanese (A2)
* I have also dabbled in
    * Russian, Italian, Korean, Chinese, Portuguese, Dutch and Spanish

### Literature
My love for languages also extends to poetry. I am currently working on a couple of poetry books. 
I have been writing poetry for almost 15 years now, and I would consider it to be a greater passion of mine than even coding.
I enjoy reading novels, especially non-fiction. 
At the moment, I spend a lot of time reading on my Kindle whenever I get the chance.

### Podcast

I am super into podcasts, and I have created one of my own
where I talk about [American culture](https://open.spotify.com/show/1PJKOQG5hVyZRTNrs2IwBl) with my co-host. 
Feel free to check it out!

## Goals
```
Thousands of candles can be lit from a single candle, 
and the life of the candle will not be shortened. 
Happiness never decreases by being shared.

- Buddha 
```
I want to contribute to worthwhile projects and improve my coding skills in the process.
I also hope to be able to teach coding to those who are also willing to learn.
My biggest goal is to get into deep learning to better perform NLP tasks 
and to understand the deeper side of things.


<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->
## Collaboration

Contributions and collaborations are what make the open source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create.
Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.

3. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the Branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

I am highly interested in collaborating. Even if it is not within the realm of deep learning or NLP,
please feel free to contact me. Maybe we can both discover something new, who knows?
