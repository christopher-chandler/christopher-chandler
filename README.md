### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

Hello everyone, my name is Chris! I am an ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸  based in ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ª. I have been interested in computers for my whole life, but just recently got into programming about a year ago. I am working on a multitude of projects and tools at the moment, but I am most interested in NLP tasks, as that my minor in my double major: French - Computational Linguistics. My goal is to get into Deep learning to better perform NLP tasks and understand the deeper side of things.
