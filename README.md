### Hey Friends 👋

Hello everyone, my name is Chris! If you speak Japanese, feel free to call me 栗栖!

I am an 🇺🇸  based in 🇩🇪. I have been interested in computers for my whole life, but just recently got into programming at the end of 2019. I am working on a multitude of passion projects and tools at the moment in order to improve my coding skills. I am mostly interested in NLP tasks, as that was my minor in my double major: 
* Generla French Philology
* Linguistics with a minor in Computational Linguistics. 
*
My goal is to get into Deep learning to better perform NLP tasks and understand the deeper side of things.
