Hello everyone, my name is Chris! If you speak Japanese, feel free to call me 栗栖!

I am an 🇺🇸  based in 🇩🇪. I have been interested in computers for my whole life, but just recently got into programming at the end of 2019. I am working on a multitude of passion projects and tools at the moment in order to improve my coding skills. I am mostly interested in NLP tasks, as that was my minor in my double major: 
* General French Philology
* Linguistics with a minor in Computational Linguistics. 

My goal is to get into deep learning to better perform NLP tasks and to understand the deeper side of things. 

If you have any questiosn or wish to contact me, please do so at christohper.chandler@outlook.de
